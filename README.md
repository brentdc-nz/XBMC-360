# XBMC-360 Alpha v1.0

This is a port of XBMC4XBOX to XBox 360 using the Microsoft XBox 360 SDK (not using Linux and Kodi).

This is only the bare skeleton of the application at the moment, there are still many missing features and minor bugs.

Current Status:

GUILIB: As of now only the basics of the GUILib have been ported and missing many control types, however the basic controls are there and working well.

DVDPLAYER: The FFmpeg based core named DVDPlayer is still missing sections/features, but it works well.

Note: The FFmpeg libraries included where ported to Xbox 360 by Ced2911, they are quite old (2011)
